- Completed Tracer Bullet: TTB PDF -> JSON (Issue #1) - Stub Implementation.
- Completed Project Scaffold: FastAPI, Pydantic, PyMuPDF, and uv setup (Issue #2).
- Completed PDF text extraction with coordinates using PyMuPDF (Issue #3).
- Key decisions: Used PyMuPDF `get_text("blocks")` for reliable coordinate extraction; used Pydantic models for structured raw data.
- Files changed:
    - src/credit_card_extraction/extractor.py (new file)
    - tests/test_extractor.py (new test)
    - plans/progress.txt (updated)
- Notes: Next step is line normalization (Issue #4).
- Completed Line Normalizer: Grouping by Y-tolerance and sorting by X (Issue #4).
- Key decisions: Used 3.0px Y-tolerance for row grouping; rows are sorted by X0 to ensure correct reading order even if columns are interleaved in raw text.
- Files changed:
    - src/credit_card_extraction/extractor.py (added NormalizedLine and normalize_lines)
    - tests/test_extractor.py (added normalization tests)
- Notes: Ready for State Machine Parser (Issue #5).
